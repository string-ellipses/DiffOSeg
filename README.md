## Updates
- [2025.08.27]üî• Our work has been **shortlisted** for the **MICCAI 2025 Best Paper and Young Scientist Awards**, ranking among the top 25 of 1014 accepted papers (from 3447 submissions) !
- [2025.06.18]üì© Our work has been accepted by **MICCAI 2025** !
- [2024.10.23]ü•à We won **2nd** place on both tasks of [MMIS-2024@ACM MM 2024](https://mmis2024.com/) !
## Method
In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. For more details, please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13087).
